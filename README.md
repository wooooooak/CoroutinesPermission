Android library Android Library for easy permission management

## Install

### Gradle

1.  Add the JitPack repository to your project level build.gradle file

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
            ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

2.  Add the dependency to your app level build.gradle file

```
implementation 'com.github.wooooooak:CoroutinesPermission:version'
```

The latest version is 1.0.2. Checkout [here](https://github.com/wooooooak/CoroutinesPermission/releases)

**Since this library uses coroutine, it is recommended to add the [following library](<[https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines)>) for convenience.**

```groovy
implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:library_version"
```

[check version here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle)

## Usage

We will use kotlin DSL for request permission.

```kotlin
yourCoroutineScope.launch {
    val result = CoroutinesPermissionManager.requestPermission(activity) {
        permissionList = listOf(Manifest.permission.CAMERA, or something..)
        Rationale {
            title = "Alert"
            message = "In order to use the app, camera permission is required."
        }
                            ...
    }
    when (result) {
        is PermissionResult.Granted -> {}
        is PermissionResult.Denied -> {}
    }
}
```

You can set the following items.

- permissionList (**required**) : List of permission to acquire.

- rationaleTitle (option) : Title for Rationale dialog.

- rationaleMessage (option) : Message for Rationale dialog.

- rationaleConfirmText (option) : Confirm button Text for Rationale dialog.

- rationaleCancelText (option) : Cancel button Text for Rationale dialog.

**Rationale example**

## Result

Result is an Sealed Class.

```kotlin
sealed class PermissionResult {

    object Granted : PermissionResult()

    class Denied(
        val deniedList: List,
        val permanentlyDeniedList: List
    ) : PermissionResult()

    override fun toString(): String {
        return when (this) {
            is Granted -> "All Permission granted"
            is Denied -> "Some Permission denied : \ndenied - $deniedList, \npermanentlyDeniedList-$permanentlyDeniedList"
        }
    }
}
```

Therefore, if the permission acquisition fails, it is possible to know which permission was not obtained and which permission was permanently denied.
